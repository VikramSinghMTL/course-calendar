# course-calendar

A React-based course calendar generator for displaying semester schedules.

## Installation

```bash
bun install
```

## Development

Run the local development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts the editor interface at `http://localhost:3000`

## Building for Production

Build the static site for deployment:

```bash
bun run build
```

This generates a production-ready site in the `docs/` directory.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

**Setup:**

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to your repository's Settings → Pages
3. Set **Source** to "GitHub Actions"
4. Push to `main` branch - the site will deploy automatically

Your site will be available at: `https://[username].github.io/course-calendar/`

### Manual Deployment

Alternatively, you can deploy manually using gh-pages:

```bash
# Build and deploy in one command
bun run deploy

# Or separately
bun run build
npx gh-pages -d docs
```

**Note:** For manual deployment, first install gh-pages: `bun add -D gh-pages`
